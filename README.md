# vizmath - Math Visualizations

This project aims to produce visualizations for
various math concepts. Currently there are
visualizations for newton's method for finding roots
of polynomial equations, inspired by 3Blue1Brown's
video on the subject, and for the Mandelbrot set,
that is a classic math graph. This project uses
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for its graphics.
