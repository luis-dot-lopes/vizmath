# vizmath - Math Visualizations

This project aims to produce visualizations for
various math concepts. Currently there are
visualizations for newton's method for finding roots
of polynomial equations, inspired by 3Blue1Brown's
video on the subject, for the Mandelbrot set,
that is a classic math graph, and for bezier curves,
that are used extensively in vector graphics. This project uses
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for its graphics.
