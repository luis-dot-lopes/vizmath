# vizmath - Math Visualizations

This project aims to produce visualizations for
various math concepts. Currently I'm working on
a visualization of newton's method for finding roots
of polynomial equations, inspired by 3Blue1Brown's
video on the subject. This project uses
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for its graphics.
